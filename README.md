- The second tab was dedicated to show the map with the states we are analyzing and the AQI for that state, the distribution of various pollutants were also presented in the same page.

- The third tab was dedicated to the distribution of the pollutants based on the time line for a particular place.

- the forth slide was the most important of them all. It had a heat-map showing the correlation between the various pollutants and how they affect us. we also had some suggestions for the people in those places to have a better life against pollution.
