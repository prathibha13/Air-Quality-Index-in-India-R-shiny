# R-shiny-project-AQI
<h3><b>Title description :</b></h3>
Clean air is the basic amenity when it comes to healthy living for mankind. Today, inadequate air
quality is one of the key causes for a variety of acute health problems. To determine its effect on
our health, it is important to know the air quality of our locality, region, and country.


<h3><b>Problem Statement :</b></h3>
The project aims at analysing Air Quality Data for various cities in India over a time
period of 2017-2019. The project analyses the same data in multiple ways using different
statistical tools and visualization tools to derive insights from the changing trends over
years

<h3><b>Work flow :</b></h3>

- We decide to used R shiny to develop a dashboard to explain our findings and insights. the first tab was dedicated to the news and current affairs related to pollution and about the dashboard.

- The second tab was dedicated to show the map with the states we are analyzing and the AQI for that state, the distribution of various pollutants were also presented in the same page.

- The third tab was dedicated to the distribution of the pollutants based on the time line for a particular place.

- the forth slide was the most important of them all. It had a heat-map showing the correlation between the various pollutants and how they affect us. we also had some suggestions for the people in those places to have a better life against pollution.

<h3><b>Result :</b></h3>
Through these graphs and statistical tools, we can see how AQI has changed over the course of
years and which pollutant is the most significant contributor to a given city. In nearly all the 8
cities that we have analysed, the air quality is lower.The line graph illustrates how the data differs
in various time frames. If we use a particular time frame, we will find the relation of the variation
and correlate it with the incidence that produced it.

<h3><b>Conclusion :</b></h3>

Air pollution is one of the biggest challenges that our country is facing right now. It’s all the more
important in our country where the common man is not quite familiar with the technical
terminologies and measuring units (like ppm /ppb / or µg/mg3). Hence the AQI simplifies the
understanding of their air quality by decoding the quality in terms of unitless numbers and colour,
with each figure and colour representing a different category of associated health risk. By
knowing which pollutant contributes more that specific pollutant can be reduced from usage. By
knowing the highest polluted city that city can take measures to avoid the air pollution in future
